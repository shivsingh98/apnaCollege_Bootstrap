## What will we cover?

### Components 
pre-built and reusable piece of user interface (UI).   
eg - button, forms

### Layouts
overall structure and arrangement of the elements.  
eg - container, grid

# Container Layout

Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them.

Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

- `.container`, which sets a `max-width` at each responsive breakpoint      

- `.container-{breakpoint}`, which is `width: 100%` until the specified breakpointm     

- `.container-fluid`, which is `width: 100% `at all breakpoints      

The table below illustrates how each containerâ€™s max-width compares to the original .container and .container-fluid across each breakpoint.

```css
<div class="container">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
```css
<div class="container-sm">100% wide until small breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-md">100% wide until medium breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-lg">100% wide until large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xl">100% wide until extra large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xxl">100% wide until extra extra large breakpoint</div>
```
```css
<div class="container-fluid">
  ...
</div>
```

# Button Components
- Base class  `class ="btn`
```css
<button type="button" class="btn">Base class</button> /* type=button is here because it should not be submit button*/
```
